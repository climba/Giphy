# Giphy

## This a javascript project

The user can add and ned HTML button with the search term that they want to see GIFs for

They can then click that button and return 10 gifs with that tag

The Gifs load in a still state 

If the user clicks on the gif the animated version loads

If the user clicks again the still version reloads
